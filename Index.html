				<h1> Asssignment 1</h1>

					 <p> It was tough making this from scratch. I remade a number of revisions before submitting homework 1 and finally organized the css and html a bit so that it made editing easier. For week 2 I added media queries to it. There are still some issues with margins, but I will look into it more deeply and review the homework comments. </p>

				<h1>Assignment 2</h1>

					<p> For the second assignment, I used the same layout as before, however incorperated bootstrap using columns and rows. I added css3 animation to the header buttons. I am not satisfied with what I have, and will change the layout to incoperate a different layout. I want to use a jumbotron and instead of having multiple html linked, use 1 instead and have it be a scroller. Similar to this: <a href=" http://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/1762?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fwebsite%2Ftemplates%2Fhtml%2Fonline-store%2F1&bookName=create-master-new&galleryDocIndex=0&category=online-store&metaSiteId=">demo</a> </p>
