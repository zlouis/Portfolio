####Assignment 1
It was tough making this from scratch. I remade a number of revisions before submitting homework 1 and finally organized the css and html a bit so that it made editing easier. For week 2 I added media queries to it. There are still some issues with margins, but I will look into it more deeply and review the homework comments.

####Assignment 2
For the second assignment, I used the same layout as before, however incorperated bootstrap using columns and rows. I added css3 animation to the header buttons. I am not satisfied with what I have, and will change the layout to incoperate a different layout. I want to use a jumbotron and instead of having multiple html linked, use 1 instead and have it be a scroller. Similar to this: demo
